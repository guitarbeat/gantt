# 📋 PhD Dissertation Planner - TODO List

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025  
**Project Status:** Active Development

## 🚨 Critical Issues (High Priority)

### Test Package Conflicts ⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
- **Issue:** Duplicate test files with conflicting package names causing `go test` failures
- **Location:** `tests/unit/` directory
- **Problem:** Files in `tests/unit/app/generator_test.go` and `tests/unit/generator_test.go` both declare `package app_test`
- **Impact:** Tests cannot run, blocking development and CI/CD
- **Solution:**
  - Rename duplicate files or merge them appropriately
  - Ensure unique package names across all test files
  - Update import paths if needed

**Affected Files:**
- `tests/unit/app/generator_test.go` (package app_test)
- `tests/unit/generator_test.go` (package app_test)
- `tests/unit/reader_test.go` (package core_test)
- `tests/unit/validation_test.go` (package core_test)

### Week Column Width Issue 🐛 **ONGOING**
- **Status:** Known issue since October 2025
- **Problem:** Week column appears too wide on Windows (works correctly on Mac)
- **Impact:** Professional appearance affected on Windows systems
- **Attempts Made:** 5 different approaches tried without success
- **Priority:** Medium (doesn't break functionality)
