# Monthly Calendar Page Configuration
# This file is used as the root config when generating monthly calendar PDFs
# It includes all settings from base.yaml and defines the monthly page

# Include base configuration (when using multiple configs, base.yaml should be specified first)
# Usage: plannergen --config base.yaml,monthly_calendar.yaml --outdir output

# This configuration generates a monthly calendar with the following features:
# - Fixed row heights for consistent layout
# - Single-day and multi-day task support
# - Hyperlinked navigation
# - Professional typography

# The actual page configuration is inherited from base.yaml
# This file exists primarily to control the output filename (monthly_calendar.tex)

# Minimal YAML structure to make this a valid config file
# (empty config that doesn't override base.yaml settings)
---
# Empty layout section to prevent overriding paper settings
