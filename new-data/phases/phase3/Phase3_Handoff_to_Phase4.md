## Quality Assurance Requirements

### 1. Data Validation
- [ ] Verify all 84 original tasks are included
- [ ] Confirm all Task IDs are unique and properly formatted
- [ ] Validate all dates are properly formatted (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Check all dependencies reference valid Task IDs
- [ ] Verify all required fields are populated

### 2. Content Validation
- [ ] Confirm professional naming conventions applied consistently
- [ ] Verify technical specifications preserved from original
- [ ] Check objective clarity and completeness
- [ ] Validate priority assignments are appropriate
- [ ] Ensure category assignments are correct

### 3. Schema Compliance
- [ ] Verify CSV format compliance
- [ ] Check UTF-8 encoding
- [ ] Validate column order and headers
- [ ] Confirm data types are correct
- [ ] Check constraint compliance

### 4. Integration Validation
- [ ] Verify timeline alignment with PhD Project Plan
- [ ] Check milestone positioning is logical
- [ ] Validate phase progression makes sense
- [ ] Confirm administrative tasks are properly distributed
- [ ] Check research task dependencies are logical

## Known Issues and Considerations

### 1. Task Mapping
- All original Task IDs (A, B, C, etc.) have been mapped to new Task IDs (T1.1, T2.1, etc.)
- Some original tasks had duplicate names (e.g., "Annual progress review" appears twice)
- All duplicates have been preserved with appropriate differentiation

### 2. Dependencies
- All dependencies have been converted to new Task ID format
- Complex dependencies (e.g., "R2,O2") have been properly expanded
- All referenced Task IDs have been verified to exist

### 3. Dates
- All dates aligned with v4 timeline as authoritative source
- Critical deadlines from data.cleaned.csv preserved
- Timeline spans 2025-08-29 to 2027-08-11

### 4. Milestones
- 7 total milestones across all phases
- 1 milestone from original data (T1.M1 - PhD Proposal Exam)
- 6 new milestones created for key deliverables

## Phase 4 Success Criteria
