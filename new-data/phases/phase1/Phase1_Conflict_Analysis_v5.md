## Detailed Conflict Resolution Strategy

### 1. Date Resolution Rules
1. **Primary Source**: Use MD timeline as authoritative source for all dates
2. **Secondary Source**: Use v4 timeline for dates not in MD timeline
3. **Tertiary Source**: Use data.cleaned.csv for dates not in either source
4. **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts exist, use v4 dates as they align with MD timeline

### 2. Task Merging Rules
1. **Overlapping Tasks**: Merge into single task with v4 naming and data.cleaned.csv technical details
2. **Similar Tasks**: Combine descriptions, use v4 naming convention
3. **Unique Tasks**: Keep as separate tasks with appropriate naming
4. **Administrative Tasks**: Preserve all from data.cleaned.csv

### 3. Naming Convention Rules
1. **Task IDs**: Use v4 format (T1.1, T2.1, etc.) with technical specifications
2. **Task Names**: Use v4 professional naming with data.cleaned.csv technical details
3. **Objectives**: Combine v4 polish with data.cleaned.csv specifications
4. **Dependencies**: Use new Task IDs, not original data.cleaned.csv letters

### 4. Category Mapping Rules
1. **PROPOSAL → Phase 1**: PhD Proposal sub-phase
2. **EQUIPMENT → Phase 1 + Phase 2**: Laser System, Microscope, Equipment Maintenance
3. **RESEARCH → Phase 2**: Aim 1, Aim 2, Aim 3 sub-phases
4. **PUBLICATION → Phase 3**: Publication sub-phase
5. **DISSERTATION → Phase 4**: Dissertation sub-phase
6. **ADMIN → All Phases**: Distributed based on timing

## Specific Conflict Resolutions

### Resolution 1: Proposal Timeline
**Conflict**: 3-day difference in proposal defense date  
**Resolution**: Use v4 date (2025-12-16) as it aligns with MD timeline  
**Impact**: Adjust all dependent tasks in data.cleaned.csv by 3 days

### Resolution 2: Equipment Setup
**Conflict**: Different laser system ready dates  
**Resolution**: Use v4 date (2025-10-11) for laser system ready  
**Impact**: Adjust equipment maintenance and research tasks accordingly

### Resolution 3: Research Phases
**Conflict**: Different AAV procurement and surgery dates  
**Resolution**: Use v4 dates for all research phase tasks  
**Impact**: Adjust all research tasks to align with v4 timeline

### Resolution 4: Task Naming
**Conflict**: Single letters vs descriptive names  
**Resolution**: Use v4 naming convention with technical specifications  
**Impact**: All tasks will have professional names with technical details

## Quality Assurance for Conflict Resolution

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All date conflicts resolved using v4 timeline
- [ ] All task overlaps merged appropriately
- [ ] All naming conflicts resolved using v4 convention
- [ ] All category mappings defined
- [ ] All dependencies updated to use new Task IDs
- [ ] All technical specifications preserved
- [ ] All administrative tasks included

### Testing Strategy
1. **Date Consistency**: Verify all dates align with v4 timeline
2. **Dependency Integrity**: Check all dependencies reference correct Task IDs
3. **Naming Consistency**: Ensure all tasks follow v4 naming convention
4. **Technical Accuracy**: Verify all technical specifications are preserved
5. **Completeness**: Confirm all 83 tasks from data.cleaned.csv are included

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Date Misalignment**: Some tasks may have conflicting dates
2. **Dependency Errors**: Dependencies may reference incorrect Task IDs
3. **Information Loss**: Technical details may be lost in merging
4. **Usability Issues**: Too many tasks may reduce usability

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Systematic Mapping**: Create detailed mapping table before integration
2. **Validation Checks**: Implement multiple validation checkpoints
3. **Technical Preservation**: Ensure all technical specifications are preserved
4. **Priority System**: Use priority system to highlight critical tasks

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create Mapping Table**: Detailed mapping from data.cleaned.csv to v4 structure
2. **Resolve Date Conflicts**: Apply v4 dates to all conflicting tasks
3. **Merge Overlapping Tasks**: Combine similar tasks with appropriate naming
4. **Update Dependencies**: Convert all dependencies to use new Task IDs

### Phase 2 Preparation
1. **Schema Design**: Create comprehensive schema accommodating all requirements
2. **Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming conventions
3. **Task ID System**: Implement scalable Task ID system
4. **Template Creation**: Create templates for task creation and validation
