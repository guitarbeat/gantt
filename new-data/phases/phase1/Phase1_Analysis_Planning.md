# Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
**Agent**: Manager Agent  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Objective**: Understand current state and define requirements for v5

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on comprehensive analysis of both source files and strategic planning for the v5 convergence. The Manager Agent will coordinate analysis, requirements definition, and integration strategy.

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of all 83 tasks from data.cleaned.csv
- Clear mapping of conflicts and overlaps between sources
- Defined requirements for v5 structure and content
- Integration strategy that preserves both breadth and polish

## Tasks

### 1.1 Current State Analysis
**Tasks for Analysis Agent:**
- [ ] **Extract data.cleaned.csv Tasks**: Parse all 83 tasks with categories, dates, dependencies
- [ ] **Create Task Inventory**: List all tasks by category with key details
- [ ] **Identify Date Conflicts**: Compare dates between data.cleaned.csv and v4 (data.cleaned.csv uses 2025-2027, v4 uses 2025-2027 but different specific dates)
- [ ] **Map Technical Specifications**: Extract specific metrics, requirements, and deliverables
- [ ] **Analyze Dependency Complexity**: Map complex multi-task dependencies from data.cleaned.csv

### 1.2 Requirements Definition
**Tasks for Planning Agent:**
- [ ] **Define Enhanced Phase Structure**: Expand v4 phases to accommodate all data.cleaned.csv content
  - Phase 1: Instrumentation & Proposal (expand to ~25 tasks)
  - Phase 2: Core Research & Analysis (expand to ~35 tasks) 
  - Phase 3: Publication (expand to ~12 tasks)
  - Phase 4: Dissertation & Graduation (expand to ~15 tasks)
- [ ] **Create Sub-Phase Hierarchy**: Map categories to sub-phases
  - PROPOSAL → Phase 1: PhD Proposal
  - EQUIPMENT → Phase 1: Laser System, Microscope + Phase 2: Equipment Maintenance
  - RESEARCH → Phase 2: Aim 1, Aim 2, Aim 3
  - PUBLICATION → Phase 3: Publication
  - DISSERTATION → Phase 4: Dissertation
  - ADMIN → Distributed across all phases
- [ ] **Plan Milestone Integration**: Identify key milestones from both sources
- [ ] **Design Task ID System**: Create scalable ID system for 80+ tasks (T1.1-T1.25, T2.1-T2.35, etc.)

### 1.3 Integration Strategy
**Tasks for Strategy Agent:**
- [ ] **Merge Task Descriptions**: Combine technical detail from data.cleaned.csv with polish from v4
- [ ] **Preserve Administrative Tasks**: Keep all compliance, paperwork, and maintenance tasks
- [ ] **Enhance Technical Specifications**: Include specific metrics and requirements
- [ ] **Maintain MD Alignment**: Ensure final structure aligns with PhD Project Plan
- [ ] **Resolve Date Conflicts**: Use MD timeline as authoritative source, adjust data.cleaned.csv dates

## Deliverables
- Complete task inventory and mapping table
- Enhanced phase structure design
- Integration strategy document
- Conflict resolution guidelines

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All 83 tasks from data.cleaned.csv identified and categorized
- [ ] All conflicts between sources documented
- [ ] Clear phase structure defined
- [ ] Integration strategy approved
- [ ] Ready for Phase 2 handoff

## Handoff to Phase 2
**Deliverables to Design Agent:**
- Task inventory with all 83 tasks mapped
- Phase structure specification
- Integration strategy document
- Conflict resolution guidelines
- Requirements for schema design
