# Phase 2: Design and Development
**Agent**: Design Agent  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Objective**: Create comprehensive schema and design standards for v5

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on designing the technical foundation for v5, including schema specification, naming conventions, and standards. The Design Agent will create the framework that enables efficient task integration.

## Success Criteria
- Complete schema specification that accommodates all content
- Clear naming conventions and standards
- Scalable Task ID system
- Template for consistent task creation

## Prerequisites
**Input from Phase 1:**
- Task inventory with all 83 tasks mapped
- Phase structure specification
- Integration strategy document
- Conflict resolution guidelines

## Tasks

### 2.1 Schema Design
**Tasks for Schema Agent:**
- [x] **Define Complete Column Set**: 
  - Phase, Sub-Phase, Category, Task ID, Dependencies, Task, Start Date, End Date, Objective, Milestone, Priority, Status, Source
- [x] **Create Category Mapping**: Map data.cleaned.csv categories to v4 phase structure
  - PROPOSAL → PhD Proposal
  - EQUIPMENT → Laser System, Microscope, Equipment Maintenance
  - RESEARCH → Aim 1, Aim 2, Aim 3
  - PUBLICATION → Publication
  - DISSERTATION → Dissertation
  - ADMIN → Distributed across phases
- [x] **Design Priority System**: 
  - Critical (milestones, defense, key deliverables)
  - High (research tasks, manuscript submissions)
  - Medium (equipment setup, data analysis)
  - Low (maintenance, administrative)
- [x] **Define Status Values**: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked, Cancelled
- [x] **Add Source Tracking**: Track which source each task came from (data.cleaned.csv, v4, or new)

### 2.2 Standards Development
**Tasks for Standards Agent:**
- [x] **Task ID System**: Scalable system for 80+ tasks
  - Phase 1: T1.1-T1.25 (Instrumentation & Proposal)
  - Phase 2: T2.1-T2.35 (Core Research & Analysis)
  - Phase 3: T3.1-T3.12 (Publication)
  - Phase 4: T4.1-T4.15 (Dissertation & Graduation)
  - Milestones: T1.M1, T2.M1, T2.M2, T4.M1, T4.M2
- [x] **Task Naming**: Professional, descriptive names combining both sources
  - Use v4 naming style but include technical details from data.cleaned.csv
  - Example: "Laser System Build & Alignment (≥30 mW output)"
- [x] **Objective Writing**: Clear, specific objectives with technical requirements
  - Combine v4 polish with data.cleaned.csv technical specifications
- [x] **Dependency Format**: Consistent dependency reference format
  - Use new Task IDs, not original data.cleaned.csv letters

## Deliverables
- Complete schema specification
- Naming conventions document
- Standards and guidelines
- Template for task creation

## Quality Gates
- [x] Schema accommodates all 83 tasks from data.cleaned.csv
- [x] Naming conventions are clear and consistent
- [x] Task ID system is scalable and logical
- [x] Standards are documented and testable
- [x] Ready for Phase 3 handoff

## Handoff to Phase 3
**Deliverables to Implementation Agent:**
- Complete schema specification
- Naming conventions document
- Standards and guidelines
- Task creation template
- Phase structure with sub-phases
