- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Focus**: Schema design and standards development
- **Document**: `Phase2_Design_Development.md`

### Phase 3: Implementation and Integration
- **Agent**: Implementation Agent
- **Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Focus**: Task integration and content creation
- **Document**: `Phase3_Implementation_Integration.md`

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Validation
- **Agent**: Quality Assurance Agent
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Focus**: Validation and quality control
- **Document**: `Phase4_Quality_Assurance.md`

### Phase 5: Final Integration and Testing
- **Agent**: Integration Agent
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Focus**: Final delivery and documentation
- **Document**: `Phase5_Final_Integration.md`
