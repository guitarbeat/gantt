# Advisor Update: Proposal, Laser, and Imaging Plan (as of 2025-08-30)

## Executive Summary
- I’ve organized 98 tasks spanning 2025-08-29 to 2027-08-15 across Proposal, Laser, Imaging, Admin/Accountability, Publication, and Dissertation tracks.
- Near-term focus: finalize the proposal outline (by 2025-08-31), set the committee and confirm exam timing (by 2025-09-05/09-12), and re-establish laser readiness for in vivo imaging (by 2025-09-12).
- Status snapshot: 1 In Progress, 97 Planned. Priority: 50 High, 45 Medium, 3 Low.
- I’ll use this plan to guide weekly 1:1s and track progress against milestones.
