# ✅ Task Stacking Fix - Complete

## What Was Fixed

Fixed the design and implementation of tasks that span multiple days. Previously, tasks would only stack properly if they started on the same day. Now, tasks stack correctly even when they start on different days but have overlapping date ranges.

## The Problem

**Your Report:**
> "on week 45 i have a event called write methods. but then its cut off by an event on the 12th called send proposal to committee. the send proposal to committee should be stacked, but it doesn't detect the earlier task."

**Root Cause:**
The code was using complex absolute positioning (`\raisebox` with calculated offsets) which:
1. Had coordinate system issues (LaTeX raises UP for positive values)
2. Didn't account for variable task content heights
3. Made the code fragile and hard to maintain

## The Solution

Replaced absolute positioning with **natural LaTeX flow**:

- ✅ Removed complex offset calculations
- ✅ Let LaTeX stack tasks naturally (earliest → latest, bottom → top)
- ✅ Added consistent 1mm spacing between stacked tasks
- ✅ Cell height expands automatically to fit all content

## Code Changes

**File:** `src/calendar/calendar.go`  
**Function:** `renderSpanningTaskOverlay()`  
**Lines changed:** ~70 lines simplified to ~45 lines

### Before (Complex):
```go
// Track stack positions for each task
var tasksToRender []struct {
    task         *SpanningTask
    stackPos     int
    isBottomTask bool
}

// Calculate Y offset based on stack position
verticalOffset := fmt.Sprintf("%.1fem", float64(tr.stackPos)*2.0)

// Use macro with offset
\TaskOverlayBoxWithOffset{color}{name}{desc}{offset}
```

### After (Simple):
```go
// Simple list of tasks
var tasksToRender []*SpanningTask

// Add spacing between tasks
if i > 0 {
    spacing = `\vspace{1mm}`
}

// Use simple macro, let LaTeX handle positioning
spacing + \TaskOverlayBox{color}{name}{desc}
```

## Verification Results

### Week 45 (November 2025)
- ✅ Nov 11: "Write Methods & Timeline" displays correctly
- ✅ Nov 12: "Send Proposal to Committee" stacks properly (doesn't cut off earlier task)

### Week 5 (February 2027)
- ✅ Feb 3: Two tasks starting same day stack correctly with proper spacing

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Code**: Removed ~30 lines of complex logic
2. **More Robust**: Works with any content length
3. **Easier to Maintain**: Natural flow is intuitive
4. **Correct Behavior**: Tasks stack properly in all cases
