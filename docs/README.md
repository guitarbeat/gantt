## 📂 Folder Structure Explained

| Folder | Purpose | Lifespan | When to Delete |
|--------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **consumable/** | One-time checklists | Temporary | After completion |
| **tasks/** | How-to guides | Permanent | Never (reference) |
| **fyi/** | Background info | Permanent | Never (historical) |

**Key Principle:** 
- If it's a **one-time task** → `consumable/` (delete when done)
- If it's a **repeatable guide** → `tasks/` (keep forever)
- If it's **historical context** → `fyi/` (keep forever)
