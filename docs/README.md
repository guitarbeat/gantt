## 📂 Folder Structure Explained

| Folder     | Purpose         | Lifespan  | When to Delete     |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| **tasks/** | How-to guides   | Permanent | Never (reference)  |
| **fyi/**   | Background info | Permanent | Never (historical) |

**Key Principle:** 
- If it's a **repeatable guide** → `tasks/` (keep forever)
- If it's **historical context** → `fyi/` (keep forever)

**Note:** One-time consumable tasks have been completed and removed to keep the repository clean and focused.
