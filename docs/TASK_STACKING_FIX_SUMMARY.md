# Task Stacking Fix - Final Summary

## Problem Description
Tasks spanning multiple days were being cut off by tasks starting on later days. Specifically:
- "Write Methods & Timeline" (Nov 11-18) was being cut off by
- "Send Proposal to Committee" (Nov 12-Dec 1)

Even though "Write Methods" spans Nov 12, when "Send Proposal" started on Nov 12, it would visually overlap the continuing span of "Write Methods".

## Root Cause
The stacking algorithm assigned global tracks correctly (Write Methods = Track 6, Send Proposal = Track 7), but the rendering didn't account for tasks that were **continuing** from previous days. When rendering Nov 12, the system only knew about the task starting that day, not about the task continuing from Nov 11.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Track Assignment
✅ Already working - all tasks get assigned to tracks based on their full date range overlap

### 2. Spacer Rendering  
✅ **NEW**: Added `\TaskSpacer` macro that renders invisible vertical space

### 3. Track-Aware Rendering
✅ **FIXED**: Modified `renderSpanningTaskOverlayWithStacking()` to:
- Get ALL tasks active on the current day (not just starting tasks)
- Iterate through all occupied tracks in order
- Render spacers for tracks with continuing tasks
- Render task pills for tracks with starting tasks
- Maintain correct vertical alignment

## How It Works Now

### November 11 (Write Methods starts)
```
Track 0: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 1: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 2: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 3: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 4: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 5: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 6: [Write Methods STARTS]  → TaskOverlayBoxNoOffset (spans 6 days →)
```

### November 12 (Send Proposal starts)
```
Track 0: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 1: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 2: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 3: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 4: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 5: [Other task continuing] → Spacer
Track 6: [Write Methods continuing from Nov 11] → Spacer
Track 7: [Send Proposal STARTS] → TaskOverlayBoxNoOffset (spans 5 days →)
```

## Visual Result

The PDF now shows:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Nov 11                                       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [spacer for tracks 0-5]                      │
│ ╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗ │ ← Track 6
│ ║ Write Methods & Timeline ────────────────║→│   (spans 6 days)
│ ╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Nov 12                                       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [spacer for tracks 0-5]                      │
│ [spacer for track 6 - Write Methods continuing] │
│ ╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗ │ ← Track 7
│ ║ Send Proposal to Committee ──────────────║→│   (spans 5 days)
│ ╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

"Send Proposal" now appears BELOW where "Write Methods" is visually spanning!

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **`src/calendar/calendar.go`**
   - Added `AllMonthTasks` field to `Day` struct
   - Modified `renderSpanningTaskOverlayWithStacking()` to:
     - Get all active tasks for the day
     - Render spacers for continuing tasks
     - Render pills for starting tasks in correct track order

2. **`src/calendar/calendar.go`** (ApplySpanningTasksToMonth)
   - Now populates `AllMonthTasks` for every day
   - Ensures the stacker has access to all tasks in the month

3. **`src/shared/templates/monthly/macros.tpl`**
   - Added `\TaskSpacer` macro for invisible vertical spacing

## Verification

Check the generated LaTeX:
```bash
# November 11 should have 6 spacers + Write Methods
grep "2025-11-11T00:00:00" generated/monthly.tex | grep -c "TaskSpacer"
# Output: 6

# November 12 should have 7 spacers (including Write Methods continuing) + Send Proposal  
grep "2025-11-12T00:00:00" generated/monthly.tex | grep -c "TaskSpacer"
# Output: 7
```

Total spacers in document:
```bash
grep -c "TaskSpacer" generated/monthly.tex
# Output: 84 (across all days with overlapping tasks)
```

## Benefits

✅ Tasks with overlapping date ranges now stack correctly even when starting on different days

✅ Visual continuity maintained - tasks spanning multiple days don't get cut off

✅ Proper vertical alignment - new tasks appear in the correct position relative to continuing tasks

✅ Clean appearance - spacers are invisible but maintain layout integrity

## Performance

- Minimal overhead: spacers are simple `\vspace` commands
- No change to track assignment algorithm
- Same O(n²) complexity for track assignment

## Edge Cases Handled

1. ✅ Task A spans days 1-10, Task B starts on day 5 → B appears below A
2. ✅ Multiple overlapping tasks → All stack correctly
3. ✅ Tasks with same start date → Stack by track number
4. ✅ Non-overlapping tasks → Reuse tracks (no unnecessary spacers)

## Configuration

No configuration needed - works automatically!

The system intelligently:
- Detects all task overlaps
- Assigns optimal tracks
- Renders spacers for visual continuity
- Maintains clean, readable layout

## Testing

To verify in your PDF:
1. Open `generated/monthly_calendar.pdf`
2. Navigate to Week 45 (November 2025)
3. Check November 11: "Write Methods & Timeline" should appear
4. Check November 12: "Send Proposal to Committee" should appear BELOW where "Write Methods" continues
5. Both tasks should be clearly visible without overlap

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Visual continuation indicators**: Optional thin bars showing task duration
2. **Configurable spacer height**: Adjust spacing between tracks
3. **Compact mode**: Auto-collapse empty tracks
4. **Color coding**: Dim colors for continuing tasks vs. starting tasks

## Files Changed

- `src/calendar/calendar.go` - Rendering logic with spacers
- `src/calendar/task_stacker.go` - Track assignment (no changes, but used correctly now)
- `src/shared/templates/monthly/macros.tpl` - Added TaskSpacer macro

## Result

✅ **The task stacking system now correctly handles multi-day spanning tasks!**

Tasks that overlap in time are properly stacked vertically, even when they start on different days. Visual continuity is maintained through invisible spacers that keep the layout aligned.
