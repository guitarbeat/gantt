## üîç Issues Investigated

### Week Column Width Problem ‚ö†Ô∏è **ONGOING**

**Problem Description:**
- Week column (left side of calendar) appears too wide on Windows
- User reports it looked correct on Mac but wrong on Windows
- Week numbers ("Week 31", etc.) take up excessive horizontal space

**Visual Evidence:**
- Preview images show week column is significantly wider than day columns
- Column appears to be 2-3x wider than it should be
- Misaligned with calendar grid

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The week column width is determined by several factors:

1. **LaTeX Column Type:**
   - Uses `tabularx` environment with custom column definitions
   - Week column defined in `DefineTable()` function

2. **Rotated Text:**
   - Week numbers are rotated 90¬∞ using `\rotatebox`
   - Text placed in `\makebox[\myLenMonthlyCellHeight][c]{Week XX}`
   - When rotated, height becomes width

3. **Configuration:**
   - `monthlycellheight` setting controls the makebox height
   - This directly affects rotated text width

---

## üîß Attempts Made

### Attempt 1: Fixed Width Column (p{6mm})
**Date:** ~9:23 PM  
**Approach:** Changed column type from `Y` (expandable) to `p{6mm}` (fixed width)  
**Code:**
```go
weekAlign := "p{6mm}|"  // Fixed 6mm width
```
**Result:** ‚ùå Did not fix the issue  
**Why:** Only affected small mode, not large mode (which is actually used)

---

### Attempt 2: Remove Column Padding (@{}l@{})
**Date:** ~9:48 PM  
**Approach:** Added `@{}` markers to remove default column padding  
**Code:**
```go
weekAlign = `|@{}l@{}!{\vrule width \myLenLineThicknessThick}`
```
**Rationale:** `@{}` removes `\tabcolsep` padding around columns  
**Result:** ‚ùå Did not fix the issue  
**Why:** Column still expanded to fit content

---

### Attempt 3: Zero-Width Header Cell (\hspace{0pt})
**Date:** ~9:53 PM  
**Approach:** Changed empty header cell from `""` to `\hspace{0pt}`  
**Code:**
```go
if full {
    names = append(names, `\hspace{0pt}`)  // Instead of ""
}
```
**Rationale:** Empty string might cause column expansion  
**Result:** ‚ùå Did not fix the issue  
**Why:** Header cell wasn't the primary cause

---

### Attempt 4: Reduce Cell Height (72pt ‚Üí 55pt)
**Date:** ~11:17 PM  
**Approach:** Reduced `monthlycellheight` to match reference repository  
**File:** `configs/base.yaml`  
**Code:**
```yaml
# Before
monthlycellheight: 72pt

# After
monthlycellheight: 55pt  # Match reference repository
```
**Rationale:** Rotated text width = makebox height, so reducing height should reduce width  
**Result:** ‚ùå Did not fix the issue (per user feedback)  
**Why:** Unknown - this should have worked based on reference repository

---

### Attempt 5: Zero-Width Paragraph Column (p{0pt})
**Date:** ~11:30 PM (latest)  
**Approach:** Force column to zero width, let rotated text overflow  
**Code:**
```go
weekAlign = `|@{}p{0pt}@{}!{\vrule width \myLenLineThicknessThick}`
```
**Rationale:** Most aggressive approach - force minimal column width  
**Result:** ‚è≥ **PENDING USER VERIFICATION**  
**Status:** PDF generated, awaiting preview images

## üí° Lessons Learned

### 1. Platform Differences Matter
- LaTeX rendering differs between MacTeX (Mac) and MiKTeX (Windows)
- Column widths, padding, and spacing can vary
- Always test on target platform

### 2. Visual Verification is Essential
- Preview images proved invaluable for debugging
- Without visual feedback, impossible to verify fixes
- Automated preview generation saves significant time

### 3. Reference Repository is Gold
- Original implementation (latex-yearly-planner) provides correct baseline
- Configuration values from reference should be trusted
- When in doubt, match the reference exactly

### 4. LaTeX Column Types are Complex
- `l` (left-aligned) vs `p{width}` (paragraph) behave differently
- `@{}` removes padding but doesn't prevent expansion
- `X` (tabularx) expands to fill space
- `p{0pt}` forces minimal width but allows overflow

### 5. Rotated Text Complicates Layout
- Height becomes width when rotated 90¬∞
- `\makebox` width directly affects column width
- Configuration values have cascading effects

---

## üîÑ Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Verify Latest Fix** - Test `p{0pt}` column approach
2. **Identify Root Cause** - If still not fixed, deeper investigation needed
3. **Compare with Reference** - Generate PDF from reference repository for comparison

### Potential Next Steps (if still not fixed)
1. **Generate Reference PDF** - Build from latex-yearly-planner to compare
2. **LaTeX Debugging** - Add debug output to see actual column widths
3. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Use `\rlap` (right overlap) to prevent width expansion
   - Use `\llap` (left overlap) for positioning
   - Try `\smash` to remove height/width from layout calculations
   - Consider using `\makebox[0pt][l]{...}` for zero-width box

### Documentation
1. **Final Summary** - Once issue is resolved
2. **Troubleshooting Guide** - For future similar issues
3. **Configuration Reference** - Document all settings and their effects

## üîç Technical Details

### LaTeX Table Structure

**Current Implementation:**
```latex
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|@{}p{0pt}@{}!{\vrule width \myLenLineThicknessThick}*{7}{@{}X@{}|}}
  \hspace{0pt} & Monday & Tuesday & ... \\
  \rotatebox[origin=tr]{90}{\makebox[55pt][c]{Week 31}} & ... \\
\end{tabularx}
```

**Key Components:**
- `@{}p{0pt}@{}` - Zero-width paragraph column with no padding
- `\rotatebox[origin=tr]{90}` - Rotate text 90¬∞ from top-right origin
- `\makebox[55pt][c]` - Box with 55pt height (becomes width when rotated)
- `\hspace{0pt}` - Zero-width space in header cell

### Configuration Values

**Current Settings:**
```yaml
monthlycellheight: 55pt  # Reduced from 72pt
tabcolsep: 4pt
arraystretch: 1.15
```

**Reference Repository:**
```yaml
monthlycellheight: 55pt  # Matches
tabcolsep: 4pt  # Matches
arraystretch: 1.0  # Different (yours: 1.15)
```

## ü§î Open Questions

1. **Why doesn't reducing cell height fix the width?**
   - Theory: Something else is overriding the width
   - Possibility: `\tabcolsep` or other spacing affecting layout

2. **Is there a difference in LaTeX packages?**
   - MiKTeX vs MacTeX rendering differences?
   - Package versions causing different behavior?

3. **Is the rotated text actually the issue?**
   - Could the column itself be the problem?
   - Is something else setting a minimum width?

4. **Does the reference repository actually work?**
   - Should build and test the reference to confirm
   - Verify our implementation matches exactly

---

## üìû Next Steps for User

1. **Verify Latest Fix:**
   - Drag new preview images into chat
   - Confirm if `p{0pt}` approach worked

2. **If Still Not Fixed:**
   - Consider building reference repository for comparison
   - May need to try more aggressive approaches
   - Could investigate LaTeX package differences

3. **If Fixed:**
   - Create final release
   - Update documentation
   - Close out the issue
