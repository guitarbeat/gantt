# Go Project Structure Guide

This document explains the beginner-friendly directory structure used in this Go project.

## 📁 Directory Overview

### Core Directories

#### `src/` - Source Code
**Purpose**: Contains all the main application source code  
**Why this name**: "src" is universally understood as "source code" - much clearer than "internal" for beginners  
**Contents**:
- `src/app/` - Main application logic and CLI handling
- `src/core/` - Core utilities, configuration, and shared business logic
- `src/calendar/` - Calendar generation, task scheduling, and layout management

#### `shared/` - Shared/Reusable Code
**Purpose**: Contains code that can be reused across different parts of the application  
**Why this name**: "shared" clearly indicates reusable code - more intuitive than "pkg"  
**Contents**:
- `shared/templates/` - LaTeX templates and rendering utilities

#### `input_data/` - Input Data Files
**Purpose**: Contains all input data files (CSV, configuration, etc.)  
**Why this name**: "input_data" explicitly shows this is where data goes in - clearer than just "data"  
**Contents**:
- CSV files with task data
- Markdown files with project plans
- Other input files

#### `generated/` - Generated Output Files
**Purpose**: Contains all files generated by the application  
**Why this name**: "generated" clearly indicates these are output files created by the program  
**Contents**:
- PDF files
- LaTeX source files
- Log files
- Compiled binaries

#### `static_assets/` - Static Files/Assets
**Purpose**: Contains static files that don't change during execution  
**Why this name**: "static_assets" is explicit about containing unchanging files  
**Contents**:
- PDF documents
- Images
- Other static resources

### Supporting Directories

#### `cmd/` - Command Line Applications
**Purpose**: Contains the main entry points for executable programs  
**Why this name**: Standard Go convention for application entry points  
**Contents**:
- `cmd/planner/` - Main CLI application

#### `vendor/` - Dependencies
**Purpose**: Contains vendored (local copies) of external dependencies  
**Why this name**: Standard Go convention for dependency management  
**Contents**:
- Local copies of external Go packages

#### `scripts/` - Build and Setup Scripts
**Purpose**: Contains shell scripts for building, testing, and setup  
**Why this name**: Self-explanatory - contains scripts  
**Contents**:
- Build scripts
- Setup scripts
- Development utilities

#### `docs/` - Documentation
**Purpose**: Contains all project documentation  
**Why this name**: Self-explanatory - contains docs  
**Contents**:
- User guides
- Developer guides
- API documentation

## 🎯 Why This Structure is Beginner-Friendly

### 1. **Clear Naming**
- `src/` instead of `internal/` - everyone knows what "src" means
- `shared/` instead of `pkg/` - "shared" is more descriptive
- `input_data/` instead of `data/` - explicit about direction of data flow
- `generated/` instead of `output/` - clear that these are created files

### 2. **Logical Grouping**
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Clear separation between input, processing, and output
- Easy to understand the data flow through the project

### 3. **Standard Go Conventions**
- Still follows Go best practices where it makes sense
- Uses `cmd/` for executables (standard Go)
- Uses `vendor/` for dependencies (standard Go)
- Maintains proper package structure within `src/`

### 4. **Self-Documenting**
- Directory names explain their purpose
- Easy to guess where to find specific types of files
- Reduces cognitive load for new developers

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
input_data/ → src/core/ → src/app/ → generated/
     ↓              ↓         ↓
static_assets/ → shared/ → cmd/planner/
```

1. **Input**: Data starts in `input_data/` and `static_assets/`
2. **Processing**: Code in `src/` processes the data
3. **Templates**: `shared/templates/` provides rendering templates
4. **Output**: Results are written to `generated/`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Look at `src/app/`** - Start here to understand the main application
2. **Check `src/core/`** - Core utilities and configuration
3. **Explore `src/calendar/`** - Calendar generation logic
4. **Review `input_data/`** - See what data the app processes
5. **Check `generated/`** - See what the app produces
