## Issue Context
```
Issue ID: demo_complex_001
Title: Performance Degradation
Description: 
            The LaTeX generation process has become significantly slower over time.
            Processing 1000+ tasks now takes 5+ minutes instead of the usual 30 seconds.
            Memory usage is also increasing linearly with task count.
            Suspected memory leak or inefficient algorithm in the template generation.
            
Complexity: complex
