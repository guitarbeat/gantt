**Issue ID**: `demo_complex_001`
**Title**: Performance Degradation
**Complexity**: Complex
**Status**: Resolved

## Description


            The LaTeX generation process has become significantly slower over time.
            Processing 1000+ tasks now takes 5+ minutes instead of the usual 30 seconds.
            Memory usage is also increasing linearly with task count.
            Suspected memory leak or inefficient algorithm in the template generation.

                    Root Cause Analysis:
                    The performance issue was caused by inefficient string concatenation in the template generation loop.
                    
                    Solution:
                    1. Replaced string concatenation with list.join() method
                    2. Added caching for frequently used template fragments
                    3. Optimized the TikZ generation algorithm
                    4. Added memory monitoring and cleanup
                    
                    Testing:
                    - Verified processing time reduced from 5+ minutes to 45 seconds
                    - Memory usage stabilized at 500MB for 1000+ tasks
                    - No regression in output quality
                    
                    Prevention:
                    - Added performance benchmarks to CI/CD pipeline
                    - Implemented memory usage monitoring
                    - Added automated performance regression tests
