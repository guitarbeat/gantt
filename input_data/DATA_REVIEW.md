## Critical Issues Found

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY: CSV Format Errors

**6 rows have extra fields causing parsing errors:**

1. **Line 15** (11 fields): Likely contains commas within a field that aren't properly escaped
2. **Line 17** (11 fields): Same issue
3. **Line 31** (11 fields): Same issue
4. **Line 35** (12 fields): Has 2 extra fields
5. **Line 56** (13 fields): Has 3 extra fields - severe formatting issue
6. **Line 89** (12 fields): Has 2 extra fields

**Impact:** These malformed rows will cause parsing errors and may result in:
- Missing tasks in the calendar
- Incorrect date assignments
- Data corruption during import

**Resolution Required:**
- Review each line and properly escape commas in text fields
- Enclose all text fields containing commas in double quotes
- Verify the data is correctly split across the 10 expected columns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY: Date Inconsistencies

**5 tasks have malformed or inconsistent end dates:**

| Task ID | Task Name | Start Date | End Date | Issue |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------|-------|
| T1.14" | Complete Proposal Document | (missing) | 2025-12-01 | End date appears in wrong column |
| T1.6a" | Email Proposal to Committee | (missing) | 2025-11-28 | End date appears in wrong column |
| T1.22" | PhD Proposal Exam - Defend proposal | (missing) | 2025-12-19 | End date appears in wrong column |
| T2.3 | Install Cranial Windows & Inject AAV | T1.12" | (missing) | Dependencies in date field |
| T4.4 | Complete Dissertation Draft | T4.5" | (missing) | Dependencies in date field |

**Pattern:** Task IDs with trailing quotation marks (") indicate CSV escaping issues. The data is shifted, causing dates to appear in the wrong columns.

**Impact:**
- Tasks cannot be rendered on the calendar
- Timeline calculations will fail
- Task dependencies may be broken

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Quality Observations

**Positive Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- ‚úÖ Logical phase progression
- ‚úÖ Reasonable task distribution
- ‚úÖ No duplicate Task IDs detected
- ‚úÖ Clear task naming convention
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive objectives for most tasks

**Minor Issues:**
- Some task objectives are very long (>100 characters) which may cause layout issues
- Milestone field is always "false" - no milestones marked
- Status field is always "Not Started" - no progress tracking

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required)

1. **Fix CSV Formatting**
   ```bash
   # Review lines: 15, 17, 31, 35, 56, 89
   # Properly escape commas in text fields
   # Ensure all rows have exactly 10 fields
   ```

2. **Fix Date Column Alignment**
   - Review tasks with Task IDs ending in `"`
   - Ensure Start Date and End Date are in correct columns
   - Remove stray quotation marks from Task IDs

3. **Validate Data**
   ```bash
   # After fixing, run validation:
   awk -F',' 'NR>1 {if(NF!=10) print "Line", NR, "has", NF, "fields"}' research_timeline_v5_comprehensive.csv
   ```

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Add Milestones**
   - Mark key deliverables as milestones
   - Suggestion: Proposal defense, each Aim completion, dissertation submission

2. **Consider Task Grouping**
   - Phase 2 has 39 tasks (36% of total) - might benefit from further subdivision
   - Phase 3 has only 10 tasks - could be merged with Phase 2 or 4

3. **Shorten Long Objectives**
   - Keep objectives under 80 characters for better display
   - Move detailed descriptions to a separate field or document

4. **Add Progress Tracking**
   - Update Status field as tasks are completed
   - Consider adding: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed", "Blocked"

5. **Verify Dependencies**
   - Many tasks have dependencies - ensure dependency chain is correct
   - Check for circular dependencies

## Data Statistics

### Temporal Distribution

```
2025: 63 tasks (59%)
2026: 38 tasks (35%)
2027: 6 tasks (6%)
```

### Task Duration Analysis

- **Shortest task:** 1 day
- **Longest task:** ~90 days
- **Average duration:** ~14 days
- **Median duration:** ~7 days

### Peak Activity Periods

Based on task start dates:
- **Sep-Dec 2025:** Proposal phase (highest density)
- **Jan-Aug 2026:** Core research execution
- **Sep-Dec 2026:** Writing and analysis
- **2027:** Final dissertation and defense

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Fix 6 malformed CSV rows (lines 15, 17, 31, 35, 56, 89)
- [ ] Correct 5 tasks with date column misalignment
- [ ] Remove trailing quotation marks from Task IDs
- [ ] Verify all rows have exactly 10 fields
- [ ] Ensure all dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] Check Start Date <= End Date for all tasks
- [ ] Verify task dependencies exist
- [ ] Consider marking key milestones

## Tools for Validation

```bash
# Count fields per row
awk -F',' '{print NR, NF}' research_timeline_v5_comprehensive.csv

# Check date format
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {if($6!~/^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$/) print "Bad start date:", NR, $6}' research_timeline_v5_comprehensive.csv

# Find tasks with dependencies
awk -F',' 'NR>1 && $4!="" {print $4, "->", $3}' research_timeline_v5_comprehensive.csv

# List all unique sub-phases
cut -d',' -f2 research_timeline_v5_comprehensive.csv | sort -u
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix the 6 malformed rows to enable proper parsing
2. **High Priority:** Correct date column misalignments for the 5 affected tasks
3. **Medium Priority:** Review and mark key milestones
4. **Low Priority:** Consider the suggested improvements for better visualization
