## Migration Path

If transitioning from v5 to v5.1:

1. **Update your build scripts** to reference new CSV file
2. **Move administrative tasks** to separate tracking system
3. **Update task IDs** in any external references
4. **Retrain team** on new task breakdown structure
5. **Monitor progress** weekly instead of monthly

---

## Conclusion

Version 5.1 is **recommended** for most users due to:
- ✅ Better measurability (96% vs 89%)
- ✅ Improved tracking granularity
- ✅ Clearer completion criteria
- ✅ No ultra-long tasks (>180 days)
- ✅ Focus on research outcomes

**Version 5.0 remains available** for those who prefer the original structure.
