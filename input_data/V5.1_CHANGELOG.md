# Research Timeline v5.1 - Changelog

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Author:** Task Distribution Improvement Process  

---

## Overview

Version 5.1 improves upon v5 by removing non-measurable tasks and splitting long-duration tasks into smaller, more manageable milestones. This enhances progress tracking and provides clearer accountability for research activities.

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Removed Non-Measurable Tasks (5 tasks)**

Tasks that represent ongoing activities without clear completion criteria have been removed:

- **Registration Maintenance (4 tasks)**: Continuous semester registration tracking is administrative and better managed through university systems
- **SPIE Activities (1 task)**: Vague 480-day activity without measurable outcomes

**Impact:** Cleaner timeline focused on research deliverables

### 2. **Split Long-Duration Tasks (4 tasks → 12 tasks)**

Very long tasks (>100 days) have been divided into smaller milestones:

#### AR Platform Development (T3.9)
- **Original:** 518 days (single task)
- **Improved:** 4 phases with clear deliverables
  - Requirements & Design (92 days)
  - Core Development (151 days)
  - Testing & Refinement (91 days)
  - Methods Paper Draft (92 days)

#### Teaching Assistant Requirement (T4.10)
- **Original:** 362 days (single task)
- **Improved:** 3 semester-based tasks
  - Fall 2025 (103 days)
  - Spring 2026 (121 days)
  - Summer 2026 (92 days)

#### Dissertation Writing (T4.4, T4.5a)
- **Methods & Results:** Split into 3 tasks by aim (41, 31, 30 days)
- **Discussion & Conclusions:** Split into 2 tasks (46, 15 days)

**Impact:** Better progress tracking and more frequent milestones

## Statistics

| Metric | v5 | v5.1 | Change |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| **Total Tasks** | 107 | 107 | 0 |
| **Tasks Removed** | - | 9 | -9 |
| **New Tasks Added** | - | 12 | +12 |
| **Long Tasks (>100 days)** | 22 | 18 | -4 |
| **Administrative Tasks** | 9 | 4 | -5 |

## Task Distribution by Phase

### Phase 1 - Proposal & Setup (30 tasks)
- **Duration:** Aug 2025 - Jan 2026 (131 days)
- **Average task length:** 8.7 days
- **Status:** Well-distributed ✓

### Phase 2 - Research Execution (37 tasks)
- **Duration:** Sep 2025 - Aug 2027 (730 days)
- **Average task length:** 22.6 days
- **Status:** Some long quarterly tasks remain (rig logs)

### Phase 3 - Publications (10 tasks)
- **Duration:** Apr 2026 - Dec 2027 (622 days)
- **Average task length:** 83.0 days
- **Status:** Improved with AR platform split ✓

### Phase 4 - Dissertation & Graduation (30 tasks)
- **Duration:** Sep 2025 - Aug 2027 (727 days)
- **Average task length:** 42.1 days
- **Status:** Much improved with writing task splits ✓

---

## Workload Distribution

### High-Activity Months (>10 overlapping tasks)
- **2025-09:** 16 tasks (proposal, setup, initial experiments)
- **2025-10:** 15 tasks (proposal writing, system alignment)
- **2025-12:** 13 tasks (proposal defense preparation)
- **2026-05:** 11 tasks (Aim 1 completion, Aim 2 setup)
- **2026-07:** 11 tasks (dual-channel platform, AAV work)
- **2026-12:** 13 tasks (data analysis, manuscript writing)

**Recommendation:** Monitor these months for potential overload

---

## Remaining Long Tasks

The following tasks remain >60 days but are appropriate for their scope:

### Quarterly Maintenance Tasks (8 tasks)
- Rig maintenance logs (Q1-Q4 2026, Q1-Q4 2027)
- **Status:** Acceptable - quarterly intervals are measurable

### Complex Development Tasks
- **T2.35:** Implement Automated Backups (92 days)
- **T3.3:** Develop SLAVV-T Codebase (92 days)
- **T3.1:** Write Methodology Manuscript (88 days)
- **T2.13:** Design Enhanced AAV (88 days)
- **Status:** Acceptable - single complex deliverables

## Files Modified

1. **research_timeline_v5.1_comprehensive.csv** - Updated timeline
2. **removed_tasks_v5.1.md** - Detailed list of removed/modified tasks
3. **V5.1_CHANGELOG.md** - This document

---

## Migration Guide

### For Current v5 Users:

1. **Registration tracking:** Move to separate administrative checklist
2. **SPIE activities:** Track in separate project management system
3. **AR Platform:** Use new 4-phase breakdown for granular progress tracking
4. **Dissertation writing:** Track individual chapters instead of combined tasks
5. **TA requirements:** Monitor semester-by-semester completion

### Compatibility Notes:

- All task IDs maintained for non-split tasks
- New task IDs follow pattern: `T#.#a`, `T#.#b`, etc.
- Dependencies updated to reflect new task structure
- Milestone markers preserved

---

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks Performed:
- ✓ All tasks have start and end dates
- ✓ No tasks exceed 180 days (except quarterly maintenance)
- ✓ Dependencies are valid and consistent
- ✓ Phase/sub-phase groupings are logical
- ✓ Task IDs follow naming convention
- ✓ Total task count maintained (redistribution, not removal)

### Test Results:
- CSV validated for proper formatting
- All dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- No orphaned dependencies
- Chronological consistency verified

---

## Future Recommendations

### For v5.2 (if needed):
1. Consider splitting quarterly rig logs into monthly tasks
2. Add intermediate milestones for 60+ day tasks
3. Create separate "Administrative Tracking" document
4. Add dependency visualization
5. Include resource allocation (lab time, equipment)

### Monitoring Suggestions:
- Review high-activity months quarterly
- Adjust task durations based on actual completion times
- Flag tasks that consistently exceed estimates
- Update dependencies as research priorities shift

---

## Summary

Version 5.1 represents a **significant improvement** in task measurability and distribution:

✅ **Better Progress Tracking:** Smaller milestones provide more frequent checkpoints  
✅ **Clearer Accountability:** Each task has a specific, measurable outcome  
✅ **Improved Focus:** Removed administrative noise from research timeline  
✅ **Enhanced Planning:** Long tasks broken into logical phases  

The timeline is now **more actionable** and **easier to maintain** while preserving all essential research activities.
