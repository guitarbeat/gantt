**Learning:** CLI users often perceive the application as "hanging" during long blocking operations like external command execution (LaTeX compilation). Adding a visual indicator (spinner) provides reassurance that the process is still active.
**Action:** When implementing blocking CLI operations, always wrap them in a spinner or progress indicator to improve perceived performance and user confidence.
